# BMI-Calculator

A BMI Calculator is a tool used to calculate a person's Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a numerical value derived from a person's height and weight and is commonly used as an indicator of body fatness. It helps determine whether an individual has a healthy body weight for their height.

How It Works:
Input:

The user provides their height (in cm or meters).

The user provides their weight (in kg or pounds).

Formula: BMI is calculated using the formula:

BMI= 

Weight (kg)
Height (m)
2
BMI= 
Height (m) 
2
 
Weight (kg)
​
 
Output: Based on the calculated BMI value, the user falls into one of the categories:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: BMI 18.5–24.9
Overweight: BMI 25–29.9
Obesity: BMI ≥ 30
